## Date Picker Component Spike
### Components Tested:
https://airbnb.io/react-dates (13.2k Used)
https://reactdatepicker.com/ (21.6k Used)
https://react-day-picker.js.org/examples/selected-week/ (7.2k Used)

### Figure Out:
Select Week
Children (toggle)

#### Airbnb React Dates:
A little hard to use
They have a lot of documentation, but not the easiest to get up and running.
Does not support children
Has an info panel that we would have to customize

### React Date Picker:
Doesn't use moment.js date objects?
Supports children (barely)

### React Day Picker
Nice demo examples
No Support for Children

### Suggestion:
Build our own component
The effort for customizing an existing component seems equal or more than to creating a new component. Since we already have the calendar service as well as the designs in place I think it would be simpler to convert our AngularJs Component to a React Component.
